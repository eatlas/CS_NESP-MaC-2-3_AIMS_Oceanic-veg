This directory contains all the intermediate files that are produced during the processing and development of this dataset. It should only contain files that are derived from the workflow described in the scripts or in a manual workflow. Products that are intended for presenting the processing on GitHub should be saved to the `media` folder and the final downloadable data files that a user of the dataset would care about should be saved in the `public` folder. 

The files in this folder allow parts of the workflow to be picked up in the middle without having to start from the start of the workflow. These files are provided to make it easy for someone planning on picking up this dataset and extending it. These files combined with the Git repository for the dataset and the public folder contains all the working files for this dataset project.
