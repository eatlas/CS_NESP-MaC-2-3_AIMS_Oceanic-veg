# Coral Sea Oceanic Vegetation  (NESP MaC 2.3, AIMS)
This dataset is a vector shapefile mapping the deep vegetation on the bottom of the coral atoll lagoons in the Coral Sea. 

This repository contains a script to download all the public datasets used to map the vegetation. It also contains the QGIS files used to prepare the data and create the preview maps. 

This repository also contains a script (`02-plot-ocean-veg-vs-drop-cam.py`) that was used to compare the mapped vegetation to the JCU drop camera results. The drop camera data is not yet published and so is not made available as part of this repository. 

The input datasets are described in the `01-download-src-data.py` script.

See the [metadata record for this dataset](https://doi.org/10.26274/709g-aq12) for more information.
